# chatgpt-personal-bot
A sample personal Telegram bot which connects to ChatGPT and can only react to a certain user.

# Setting up
You only need to fill up the `context.json` file with your personal preferences and start up the script! The guidelines for context messages can be found in the official documentation: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction
